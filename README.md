# Heart-Diease-Prediction
This is a prediction model building workbook, testing three Machine Learning Algorithm to see which predicts best. The goal is to predict the presence of heart diease in patient.

The dataset is a Heart test dataset for patients. The model is to predict whether a patient has Heart Disease or not, using the following Algorithms: RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, and LogisticRegression. This is a Classification Superivised Machine Learning.

Before ML was carried out, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was done on the dataset. 

Test the accuracy score of the 3 Algorithms listed above, it was discovered that Logistic Regression had best accuracy rate of 85.25%.
